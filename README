Droopy is a prolog bot for MediaWiki projects. It is still under development
and at the current stage nothing very useful should be expected. This will,
hopefuilly, change in the future.

Droopy is primarily intended to scrutinize wikipedia and create reports, rather
than doing routine maintenance work or adding articles. Possible future uses
include:

* Checking sitematrices over various projects for consistency
* Checking category hierarchies for consistency
* Checking for articles that are largely written by SPA's
* Checking for (link)spam

== Platform ==
Droopy was written and tested using SWI-Prolog (version 5.10.1) and should run
on all platforms supporting it. It *may* run using other compilers/interpreters
but, to date, i haven't actually tried it. If you do, good luck and let me know
wether or not you are succesful.
